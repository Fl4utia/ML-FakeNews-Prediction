# ML-FakeNews-Prediction
Machine learning model that can  predict whether a given news article is fake or genuine. Fake news has become a significant issue in today's digital age, with the potential to mislead and manipulate public opinion. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we seek to build a robust classifier that can help identify and combat the spread of fake news.

## Dataset


The dataset used for this project consists of labeled news articles, with each article labeled as either "fake" or "real." The dataset was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emineyetm/fake-news-detection-datasets/data) and contains more than 12,600 articles for training and testing the model. 


## Model Selection

We experimented with several machine learning algorithms to find the best-performing model for fake news detection. The following models were evaluated:
- Logistic Regression (LR)
- Decision Tree (DT)
- Gradient Boosting Classifier (GBC)
- Random Forest Classifier (RFC)
